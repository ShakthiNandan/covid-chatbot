COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
+
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
+
Wuhan,china  in December 2019, were fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%) and dry cough (59.4%)4.
+
The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.
+
A person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 hours before starting to experience symptoms. In fact, people without symptoms may be more likely to spread the illness, because they are unlikely to be isolating and may not adopt behaviors designed to prevent spread.
+
You can pass on the infection to others, even if you have no symptoms. Many people with COVID-19 will no longer be infectious to others after 5 days. If you have a positive COVID-19 test result, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 5 days after the day you took your test.
+
Avoid crowds and close contact. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings. Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
+
Zhang was the first to report the novel coronavirus; Dr. Li just blew the whistle. Both of them are worth remembering. At present, Chinese health-care workers have made a miracle in the fight against COVID-19.
+
Most people with COVID-19 get better within a few days to a few weeks after infection, so at least four weeks after infection is the start of when post-COVID conditions could first be identified. Anyone who was infected can experience post-COVID conditions.
+
A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time.
+
Some people describe COVID sore throat as the most painful sore throat they've ever experienced. Others report a sore throat that isn't too different from one caused by a regular cold. Other COVID sore throat symptoms people notice include: Pain when swallowing or talking.
+
Based on what researchers have learned about COVID-19 thus far, the first symptoms—which generally occur within seven days after infection—can include the following, which are listed in order of their usual appearance: Fever or chills. A persistent cough.
+
A dry cough is one of the most common coronavirus symptoms, but some people may have a cough with phlegm (thick mucus). It can be difficult to control your cough but there are a few ways to help.
+
Mild COVID-19 means you have symptoms — such as cough, sore throat, and fatigue — but no shortness of breath. Most of the time, people can treat mild COVID-19 at home. There are treatments specific to COVID-19 for certain people, so contact your healthcare provider to discuss your options.
+
COVID-19 symptoms can be more gradual. While COVID-19 symptoms can develop as early as two days after you're infected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says five days after infection is typical.
+
A negative COVID-19 test means the test did not detect the virus, but this doesn't rule out that you could have an infection. If you used an antigen test, see FDA instructions on repeat testing. If you have symptoms: You may have COVID-19, but tested before the virus was detectable, or you may have another illness.
+
Keep a daily routine, such as taking a shower and getting dressed.
Take breaks from COVID-19 news and social media.
Eat healthy meals and drink plenty of fluids.
Stay physically active.
Get plenty of sleep.
Avoid use of drugs, tobacco and alcohol.
+
On June 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added three symptoms to its COVID-19 list: Congestion/stuffy nose, nausea and diarrhea. Those three new conditions now join other symptoms identified by the CDC: Fever. Cough.
+
Fever or chills, Cough,
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache,
New loss of taste or smell.
Sore throat.
+
Isolate when you test positive for COVID-19, to protect others. Day 1 is the day after symptoms start (or after the day of your first positive test if you don't have symptoms). Count from Day 1 and test on Day 5 (or later).
+
Although a fever is a common symptom of this virus, it's still possible to have COVID-19 without a fever, especially within the first few days after being infected. In fact, one study found that just 55.5% of the surveyed COVID-19 patients reported experiencing a fever.
+
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and fluids. Use pillows at night to elevate your head for a dry cough. Take cough drops to soothe your throat. Use a cool mist humidifier with water only.
+
While you don't need to stay in bed, you should get plenty of rest. Stay well hydrated. To reduce fever and ease aches and pains, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure to follow directions.
+
A lot of the symptoms of viral infections – fever, cough, headache, loss of smell – overlap for COVID-19 and other viral infections like the flu, respiratory syncytial virus and the common cold.
+
Reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 means a person was infected, recovered, and then later became infected again. After recovering from COVID-19, most individuals will have some protection from repeat infections. However, reinfections do occur after COVID-19.
+
With COVID-19, researchers haven't discovered a genetic mutation that makes anyone completely immune (not yet, at least).
+
Don't go to the gym or other shared spaces if you're sick with COVID-19. While you're contagious, isolate yourself from others.
+
Symptoms can last anywhere from 1 to 21 or more days. If your child gets COVID-19 they should stay quarantined at home for 10 days after positive testing or onset of symptoms, and must demonstrate improving symptoms without fever for 24 hours.
+
Day 0 is the day you were tested (not the day you received your positive test result) Day 1 is the first full day following the day you were tested.
+
If you no longer have symptoms after five days or are fever-free for at least 24 hours without using a fever-reducing medication, you do not need to take another COVID-19 test to confirm you are no longer positive, unless you have been directed to by your workplace or school.
+
While most of us know some of the common symptoms of COVID-19—such as fever, shortness of breath, and a dry cough—it's quite common to experience gastrointestinal distress, such as diarrhea. That's because diarrhea is the body's way of quickly disposing of viruses, bacteria, and toxins from the digestive tract.
+
Public health officials agree that the end of the pandemic is in sight but not here yet.
+
A POSITIVE result must show BOTH a BLUE line and a PINK line near the BLUE line. Look closely! Even a very faint, pink Test Line and a blue Control Line is a POSITIVE result. The intensity of the lines may vary.
+
Sometimes, people can get a positive COVID-19 test result even though they no longer have COVID-19. This is because people with COVID-19 have infected cells in their body that release the virus into the environment through breathing, sneezing or coughing, or through their faeces and urine.
+
Alcohol use, especially heavy use, weakens the immune system and reduces its ability to cope with infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most severe complications of COVID-19.
+
As with any illness, it is important to take care of yourself if you have or suspect you have COVID. Make sure you get adequate rest and stay hydrated to help you feel better as quickly as possible. Over-the-counter medicines might also help you manage your symptoms.
+
People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.
+
Children of all ages can get the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and experience its complications. Know the possible symptoms of COVID-19 in children and what you can do to protect your child.
+
Some newborns have tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after birth. We don't know if these newborns got the virus before, during, or after birth. Most newborns who tested positive for COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and recovered. Reports say some newborns developed severe COVID-19 illness.
+
Yes, COVID-19 can spread via airborne transmission. When people with the COVID-19 infection breathe out, clear their throats, cough, sneeze, speak, or otherwise move air out through their nose or mouth, droplets of all different sizes, which can contain the virus, are ejected into the air.
+
The Link Between Your Genetics & COVID-19.
Since the start of the pandemic, scientists have been investigating whether some people are genetically “immune” to COVID-19. This is actually the case with HIV: some have a genetic mutation that prevents the virus from entering their cells.
+
The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals during close contact. Pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. The risk of pets spreading COVID-19 to people is low.
+
The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic (1). At a news briefing, WHO Director-General, Dr.Li
+
If you have 1 line by C, and 1 line by T this is called a positive result. The lines can be bright or faint. You have COVID-19. Negative result. If you have 1 line by C, and no line by T this is called a negative result.
+
Two lines – even faint lines – indicate the test is positive. The test has failed and should be retaken. Negative result.
+
One coloured line should be in the control line region (C), and another coloured line should be in the test line region (T). Two lines, one next to C and one next to T, even faint lines, show the test is positive. If you test positive, you and your. household should self-isolate following.
+
How long will COVID-19 last if my child gets it? Symptoms can last anywhere from 1 to 21 or more days. If your child gets COVID-19 they should stay quarantined at home for 10 days after positive testing or onset of symptoms, and must demonstrate improving symptoms without fever for 24 hours.
+
We do know that smoking damages your lungs and that COVID-19 causes mild to severe breathing problems. This means that if you keep smoking and you become sick with COVID-19, you're more likely to have worse symptoms than someone who doesn't smoke and gets COVID-19.
+
For a COVID PCR swab test, you should: Avoid nasal sprays or any other solution in the nose for 24 hours before your test. Avoid eating salty meals or drinking alcohol for 2 hours before your test.
+
Damage to heart muscle cells causes troponin and creatine kinase to leak out of the heart into the blood. High levels of these enzymes on blood tests are a clear sign the heart's in trouble. “The presence of these enzymes identifies heart attacks,” says Dr. Glassberg.
+
Coronavirus does not seem to spread to babies through breast milk. It's safe to breastfeed if you have COVID-19.
+
Reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 means a person was infected, recovered, and then later became infected again. After recovering from COVID-19, most individuals will have some protection from repeat infections. However, reinfections do occur after COVID-19.
+
After someone recovers from COVID-19, they develop antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 if they are exposed again. If you do not get vaccinated and only rely on this type of immunity, you are more susceptible to getting sick again or experiencing severe disease if there is a new variant.
+
We present here the first case of COVID-19 infection reported in Kerala, India. On January 27, 2020, a 20 yr old female presented to the Emergency Department in General Hospital, Thrissur, Kerala, with a one-day history of dry cough and sore throat. There was no history of fever, rhinitis or shortness of breath.
+
RT-PCR tests are very accurate when properly performed by a health care professional, but the rapid test can miss some cases. Antigen test. This COVID-19 test detects certain proteins in the virus. Using a long nasal swab to get a fluid sample, some antigen tests can produce results in minutes.
+
What is the full form of RT PCR test? The full form of RT-PCR is Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. A Covid RT PCR test is conducted to find the presence of Coronavirus that causes Covid 19.
+
A health care professional collects a fluid sample by inserting a long nasal swab (nasopharyngeal swab) into your nostril and taking fluid from the back of your nose. A sample may be collected by using a shorter nasal swab (mid-turbinate swab) or a very short swab (anterior nares swab).
+
The rapid test can't detect small amounts of the virus or asymptomatic cases as accurately as the PCR test can,” Heather said. The rapid test is less accurate and there is a greater chance for a false negative.
+
A minimum of four hours is required to get the RT-PCR test results and gauge the extent of infection in an individual.
+
Most often, eye symptoms are associated with systemic symptoms of COVID, including the typical features of the respiratory illness we're familiar with including cough, fever, and fatigue." When the eyes are exposed to the virus, a person can develop conjunctivitis symptoms, often appearing like pink eye.
+
Inflammation can change hormone levels or the lining of the uterus. The hormone changes could then result in temporary changes to your period. People have reported missing periods, bleeding between periods, longer cycles, shorter cycles, heavier bleeding, or less bleeding after having COVID-19 or the vaccination.
+
Vitamin C: 500 mg BID or 1000 mg daily.
Quercetin 250-500mg twice a day.
Zinc 75-100 mg/day.
Melatonin (slow release): Begin with 0.3mg and increase as tolerated to 2mg at night.
Vitamin D3: 1000-4000 u/day.
Optional: Famotidine 20-40mg/day.
